### Hi there 👋

This place belongs to Anurag Sarkar. 🤖

Anurag graduated from VIT university in 2019 and a has degree in **Electrical Engineering**. 😱😱😱

But like everyone else he is a software engineer
but unlike many he knows the difference between npn and pnp. 😌😌

Anurag has participated over **40 hacks** and won over 19 of them, but he doesn't brag about it. 💲💲


Anurag is currently working as a **Software engineer @ Swiggy**. 🤓

He has previously worked with **Prakshep**, **Johnson controls**, **Hyperledger** and **OYO Rooms**.

Anurag is really good at **Data structure and Algorithms** but sometimes he forgets how to **invert a binary tree**.

So he is probably not going to crack **Google** anytime soon.


Anurag is a backend Engineer but his frontend skills are just 🔥 becuase he breaks all of it.


Anurag can write code in **Java**, **Python**, **Golang** and **Javascript**.


Anurag loves travelling like everyone else.

Anurag also wants to be ***famous*** so please follow him here. ☺️
